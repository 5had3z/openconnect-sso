    installation of ``Qt`` by declaring dependencies to ``PyQt5`` and
    ``PyQtWebEngine`` optional.

    As it is now possible to choose between a bundled or preinstalled version of
    Qt, that means that ``PyQt5`` is no longer a required dependency. To keep
    installing ``openconnect-sso`` with all its dependencies::

        $ pip install --user --upgrade "openconnect-sso[full]"

    To use the systemwide installation of ``PyQt5`` and ``PyQtWebEngine``
    install them via your distribution's package manager::

        \# apt install python-pyqt5 python3-pyqt5.qtwebengine

    Then install ``openconnect-sso``::

        $ pip install --user --upgrade openconnect-sso
