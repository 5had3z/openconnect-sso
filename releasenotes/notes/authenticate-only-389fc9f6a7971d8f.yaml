    ``--authenticate [json|shell]`` command line argument
      Exits after authentication and displays the authentication information
      needed to initiate a connection. When the ``shell`` output format is
      used the output is formatted the same way as ``openconnect`` formats its
      output when the same argument is used. When ``json`` format is used, the
      same information is displayed in json format.

      Kudos to @rschmied for the original pull request.

    ``--version/-V`` command line argument
      Displays the version of ``openconnect-sso``

upgrade:
  - |
    Use the ``--authenticate`` command line argument instead of``--auth-only``.
    The latter argument has been removed from this version of
    ``openconnect-sso``.
