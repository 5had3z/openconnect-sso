    It is strongly suggested to remove the ``[auto_fill_rules]`` section from
    the configuration file or delete the entire file located at
    ``$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/openconnect-sso/config.toml`` (most probably
    ``~/.config/openconnect-sso/config.toml``). The fix of #4 involves an update
    of the auto-fill rules but unfortulately they are persisted when the
    application is first started. Removing them from the configuration forces
    the updated set of rules to be written in the configuration.

    The embedded browser will now stop and waits for user input when the
    previously stored credentials are invalid. This still not the proper
    solution as saved credentials are not updated in that case but at least the
    infinite login loop is circumvenied.
